# TeamOS (fdeOS) — Team Operating System

A Claude Code framework for Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) to manage multiple customer engagements: standardized tracking files, Slack/Google Drive auto-sync, and generated reports (weekly trackers, barrier reports, standup agendas), all driven through Claude Code skills rather than a separate app.

## Overview

TeamOS (internally also called "fdeOS") solves a specific problem: FDEs juggle several customer engagements at once, each with its own stakeholders, blockers, and timeline, and leadership needs consistent, timely rollups across all of them. Instead of a database or web app, TeamOS keeps each engagement's state in a small set of structured Markdown files under `customers/[customer-name]/`, and uses Claude Code skills to read, update, and report on those files. There is no server, no build step, and no deployment — you clone/copy the folder and start running skills against it in Claude Code.

```

There is no separate persistence layer or database — **the Markdown tracking files under `customers/` are the memory.** Claude reads them at the start of a skill invocation and writes back to them at the end. Two structures are supported depending on engagement complexity (see [Choosing project structure](#choosing-project-structure)), and a project can migrate from simple to complex in place without losing data.

## Features

- Consistent, template-driven tracking of stakeholders, barriers, learnings, and timeline per customer engagement
- Auto-sync from Google Drive (meeting transcripts) and Slack into structured tracking files, with a dated change log per sync
- Generated, form-ready weekly tracker submissions (Momentum Program), leadership barrier reports, Slack weekly updates, and standup agendas
- Shareable framework: the skills/templates are meant to be copied between FDEs, while each person's customer data and profile stay private (see [Sharing TeamOS](#sharing-teamos))

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) CLI.
- A global user profile at `~/.claude/memory/user_profile.md` (name, role, team, communication preferences) — TeamOS skills read this for personalization, but it isn't provisioned by this repo.
- Access to whatever Google Drive folders and Slack channels a given customer engagement references (configured per-customer, not globally — see Configuration).

## Installation / Setup

```bash
# 1. Get the framework onto your machine (copy or clone into your workspace)
cd ~/TeamOS   # or wherever you keep it

# 2. One-time: set up your personal profile
# Tell Claude: "set up my TeamOS profile" — it creates ~/.claude/memory/user_profile.md
```

There is no package manager, dependency install, or build step — TeamOS is a directory of Markdown templates and Claude Code skills, not a compiled or served application.

## Configuration

TeamOS has no global environment variables or secrets file. Configuration is per-customer, stored directly in that customer's own tracking files:

| Setting | Where | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| M120 Slack channel (Momentum Program account channel) | `customers/[name]/CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` | `/fde-tracker-submit` |
| Google Drive folder link | `customers/[name]/CLAUDE.md` | `/project-sync` |
| Additional Slack channels | `customers/[name]/CLAUDE.md` | `/project-sync` |

Google Drive and Slack access are provided through whatever MCP connectors/integrations are configured in your Claude Code environment — TeamOS itself does not manage authentication.

**Never commit `customers/`.** It's excluded via `.gitignore` (`customers/*/` with a `!customers/.gitkeep` exception to preserve the folder structure) precisely because it holds real customer engagement data. If you find yourself about to override that, stop and reconsider.

## Usage

All usage is conversational, through Claude Code skills — there's no CLI binary to invoke directly.

```text
"Set up a new project for Acme Corp"        → /project-setup
"Sync the project"                          → /project-sync (run from inside customers/acme-corp/)
"/fde-tracker-submit"                       → weekly Momentum Program tracker submission
"Generate barrier report"                   → /barrier-report, aggregated across all customers
"Generate weekly update"                    → /weekly-update-account-team
"Prep standup" / "what should I bring up"   → /standup
```

Recommended cadence: `/project-sync` daily Monday–Wednesday (each run creates `updates/YYYY-MM-DD-sync.md`), then `/fde-tracker-submit` Thursday morning to roll the week's change logs into a form-ready submission.

## Choosing project structure

**Simple** (1–2 agents sharing stakeholders/timeline/barriers):
```
customers/acme-corp/
├── CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, STAKEHOLDERS.md, BARRIERS.md, LEARNINGS.md, TIMELINE.md
└── updates/
```

**Complex** (3+ agents with independent workstreams):
```
customers/acme-corp/
├── STAKEHOLDERS.md, TIMELINE.md   # customer-level, shared
└── agents/
    ├── sales-forecasting/{AGENTS,BARRIERS,LEARNINGS}.md, updates/
    └── service-automation/...     # same structure
```

Start simple; `/new-agent-workstream` converts to complex automatically when needed (data is moved, not deleted).

## Project structure (full reference)

See [Architecture](#architecture) for the top-level layout. Per-customer tracking files, in detail:

- **CLAUDE.md** — strategic context: objectives, constraints, key decisions, workflows, M120 channel
- **AGENTS.md** — agent metadata for tracker submissions: types, phases, status, go-live dates, sentiment, implementation partners
- **STAKEHOLDERS.md** — who's involved, communication styles, concerns, decision authority
- **BARRIERS.md** — blockers organized by product area, with impact and next steps
- **LEARNINGS.md** — successes ✅, challenges ⚠️, patterns 💡, retrospectives 🔄
- **TIMELINE.md** — week-by-week narrative, not just a date list
- **updates/**, **standups/**, **weekly-updates/** — generated/dated output, not hand-authored

## Testing

There is no automated test suite. TeamOS is a set of Markdown templates and Claude Code skill prompts, not executable application code — correctness is verified by running each skill against a real or sample customer folder and reviewing the generated output.

## Deployment

Not applicable in the traditional sense — there's nothing to build or deploy. "Deploying" TeamOS to a new machine or teammate means copying the framework (see [Sharing TeamOS](#sharing-teamos)) and running the one-time profile setup.

## Sharing TeamOS

✅ Share: the framework itself — skills, templates, documentation.
❌ Don't share: your `~/.claude/memory/` (personal profile) or your `customers/` folder (real engagement data).

Each person who adopts TeamOS keeps their own profile and their own `customers/` folder; only the framework (skills + templates) is common.

## Contributing

This is an internal FDE tool, evolved by whoever's using it. There's no formal review process — customize templates for your engagement types, add skills for workflows you find yourself repeating, and adjust the simple/complex structures to match your team's needs. If you change a skill's behavior in a way that affects shared customers/ file formats, update the corresponding `templates/project/*.md.template` to match.

## Tips

1. Sync regularly — weekly at minimum, ideally after major meetings.
2. Keep `BARRIERS.md` current as blockers resolve; stale barriers make leadership reports misleading.
3. Capture learnings as decisions happen, not in retrospect.
4. Let auto-sync update files, then review the change log rather than editing tracking files by hand.
5. Generate reports often — leadership prefers frequent, timely updates over comprehensive-but-late ones.
